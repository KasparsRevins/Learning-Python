"""
Rock, paper, scissors is a popular hand game for two players.
The two players simultaneously choose one of the three possible moves and determine the winner of the game: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.
This exercise involves determining a gameâ€™s outcome given the moves of the two players.
