Averages are an essential statistical tool, and computers make it easy to calculate the average of millions or billions of numbers. 
The average is the sum of a set of the numbers divided by the amount of numbers. 
For example, the average of 12, 1, and 5 is 6, because 12 + 1 + 5 is 18 and 18 / 3 is 6. This and the following two exercises challenge you to make Python solve these statistics calculations.

Exercise Description

Write an average() function that has a numbers parameter. This function returns the statistical average of the list of integer and floating-point numbers passed to the function. 
While Pythonâ€™s built-in sum() function can help you solve this exercise, try writing the solution without using it.
