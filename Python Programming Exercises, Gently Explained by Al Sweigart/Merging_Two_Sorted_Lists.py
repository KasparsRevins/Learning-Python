"""
One of the most efficient sorting algorithms is the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort has two phases: the dividing phase and the merge phase. 
We wonâ€™t dive into this advanced algorithm in this book. However, we can write code for the second half: merging two pre-sorted lists of integers into a single sorted list.
Write a mergeTwoLists() function with two parameters list1 and list2. The lists of numbers passed for these parameters are already in sorted order from smallest to largest number. 
The function returns a single sorted list of all numbers from these two lists.
